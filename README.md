A game made in unity for Game Begetter Competiton


*(Important)   I haven't uploaded one folder which has the controlls to some of the animations(Dance animation at the begining, and some more)  onto github because it was over 100 mb and I am using the free version of github. Sorry for the trouble.

*(Important) Also because of the above reason i could not upload the Game apk.
